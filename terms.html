                    After purchase, you will receive your premium code via email. To activate:
                </p>
                <ol>

                <p>
                    <strong>24-Hour Codes:</strong> The 24-hour validity period begins at the moment of first 
                    activation. The code can be used on multiple devices during this period.
                </p>
                <p>

                <h4>3.4 Code Security</h4>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for keeping your premium code confidential. Do not share your code 
                    publicly. We are not liable for unauthorized use of your code if you have shared it with 
                    third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each code can only be activated once. After the initial activation, the code is bound to 
                    your session (for 24h codes) or can be reused across sessions (for permanent codes).
                </p>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verify you entered the code correctly (case-sensitive)</li>
                    <li>Check if the code has expired (for 24h codes)</li>
